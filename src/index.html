       @todo: index.js and its module dependencies are bundled by deno's internal bundling tool.
       The result is a single systemjs module loader file which is ridiculously massive in size
       and not something to ship to production.

       At this stage I don't see deno bundlers out there that do what webpack and rollup can do.
       It seems it would be better to go with a pure ESM approach when building client-side logic
       and deploying JS. Maybe only a minification step.

       Main concern with this approach is performance. It seems the only way to truly know is 
       to build an application entirely using es modules and test the load times.

       This is a great starting point for exploring ESM modules:
