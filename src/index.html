       @todo: index.js and its module dependencies are bundled by deno's internal bundling tool.
       The result is a single systemjs module loader file which is ridiculously massive in size
       and not something to ship to production.

       At this stage I don't see deno bundlers out there that do what webpack and rollup can do.
       It seems it would be better to go with a pure ESM approach when building client-side logic
       and deploying JS. Maybe only a minification step...

       This is a great starting point for exploring ESM modules:
